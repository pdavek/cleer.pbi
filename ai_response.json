"The user input and the correct answer both appear to have the same logic and structure for the DAX measure `my_measure`. The only difference is the presence of the extra `=` in the user input. It seems like a typo, but it does not affect the logic of the measure as it will still work correctly in Power BI or Excel.\n\nTherefore, based on the correct answer provided, the user input can be considered correct.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to ask."
