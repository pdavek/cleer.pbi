I need to know how much sales Mike made in December 2023 but unfortunately the date is just a number formatted like 27122023. Can you write me DAX to solve this issue?",

In both cases data is stored in the [temperature] and [date] columns and a relationship on dates is active. \r\nNow that I think about it, I'm not sure if 'weather_2023' has lowest an highest temperature for each day, please ensure you are only taking the highest.
