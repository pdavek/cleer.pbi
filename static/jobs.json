        "question": "There is a sales table called 'sales' within the database. It only has 3 columns: date, sales_amount, seller. I need to know how much sales Mike made in December 2023 but unfortunately the date is just a number formatted like 27122023. Can you write me DAX to solve this issue?",
        "answer": "*=calculate(sum('sales'[sales_amount]), 'sales'[seller]= 'Mike' && right(text('sales'[date], 00000000), 4) = '2023' && mid(text('sales'[date], 00000000), 3, 2) = '12')"
